Hide a bat in a corner of your website. The bat can be triggered by user interaction, or page load.
Users will disturb a bat that was sleeping on your page.
This effectively turns your page into a cave. This is good for the ecosystem of the internet, as there are not enough bats on websites (there never have been) and this is bad for web bat populations.

Installing "a cute bat" is easy. Simply drag and drop the contents of the downloaded folder (audio, images, and a_cute_bat.js) into the root directory of the page that you would like to add the bat to.

Once bat has been successfully uploaded to your server, add the following in your page's `<header>` tag...
```javascript
<script src="a_cute_bat.js"></script>
```

Then simply call...
```javascript
<body onload="init_bat();">
```

As part of your body's on load, or call  `init_bat() ` as part of any button event that you would like to bind your bat to.

Visitors will be surprised by the bat!
